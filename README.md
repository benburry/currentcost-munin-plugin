currentcost-munin-plugin
========================

A munin plugin for [CurrentCost](http://www.currentcost.com/)

This works with an older 2400 baud currentcost model. 

Allows graphing (through munin) of the temperature and watts readings from the device. 
Symlink 'currentcost_t' and/or 'currentcost_w' to this script in the munin plugins dir to enable each reading.
